# sitegen

A simple personal site generator from which you can select different styles.

## Usage

Fill out `data.json` with your information. Then to generate your `index.html` file, run

```
node .
```

After, create a seperate directory with the newly created `index.html` and the CSS file with the theme that you want to use.
